Neural Network Training


The setup of the neural network is as follows:
SYMBOL TABLE
	- clef
		- G
		- F
		- C
	- note
		- real note
	 		- eighth
	 		- half
	 		- quarter
	 		- whole
	 	- rest
	 		- eighth rest
	 		- quarter rest
	 		- whole-half rest
	 	- extra
	 		- sharp
	 		- flat

The function trainGeneralNN will take as parameters the training inputs and labels, and it will train the neural network into classifying whether a symbol is either a note or a clef. The function trainClefNN will take as parameters training inputs and labels, and it will train the neural network that just takes in clef inputs into determining the specific type of clef, as it is a G, F, or C clef. The training functions will call the hyperparameter tuning function with different layers to determine the best model.

The models trained for the general NN include:
	[ [50, 'relu'], [20, 'relu'], [2, 'softmax'] ]

	[ [20, 'relu'], [15, 'tanh'], [2, 'softmax'] ]

	[ [50, 'relu'], [2, 'softmax'] ]

	[ [40, 'tanh'], [2, 'softmax'] ]

	[ [50, 'sigmoid'], [2, 'softmax'] ]

	[ [300, 'relu'], [2, 'softmax'] ]


The models trained for the clef specific NN include:
	[ [50, 'relu'], [20, 'relu'], [3, 'softmax'] ]

	[ [20, 'relu'], [15, 'relu'], [3, 'softmax'] ]

	[ [25, 'relu'], [5, 'relu'], [3, 'softmax'] ]

	[ [30, 'relu'], [15, 'relu'], [3, 'softmax'] ]

	[ [50, 'sigmoid'], [3, 'softmax'] ]

	[ [10, 'relu'], [3, 'softmax'] ]


The models were trainied and the weights were saved for predictions. 
To do the prediction, the predict function will be used, which takes a symbol input as parameter. 
It will first determine whether the symbol is a note, if it is a note, then it will go to the note specific predictions. Else, it is a clef, and it will be determined what type of clef it is.
