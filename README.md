# Rhythm
An application that allows users to convert handwritten music sheets into a digital format that can be easily tested, customized, and shared with others.
Project Objectives:
1. Create an easy and intuitive approach to convert written sheet music into virtual sheet music via images taken from the phone camera
2. Provide an interface to modify virtual sheet music with the use of the user’s handheld device, by moving, adding, or removing notes, and and allowing the user to change the instrument that the sheet should be played with
3. Play the music on the virtual sheets using different instruments live from the user’s device
4. Allow users to create libraries of compositions, which are composed of multiple virtual music sheets
